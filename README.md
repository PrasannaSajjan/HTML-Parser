# HTML-Parser
HTML Parser to parse html files to plain words

A simple HTML Parser which can be used to scan the html files and extract only words from them and ignore all the tags & other styling
elements present inside the HTML file.

This program will only accept one file at a time and output the words into a text file. This text file in turn can be used as an input
to stemmers such as Porter or Krovetx for further analysis. (That was my original intention to write this program)
